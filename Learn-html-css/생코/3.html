      <h2>JAVA SCRIPT</h2>
      JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəskrɪpt/), often abbreviated as JS, is a programming
      language and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and
      CSS. As of 2024, 98.8% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
      webpage behavior,[10] often incorporating third-party libraries. All major
      web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on
      users' devices.
